## Eat The Rainbow

I created this web app to serve those who utilize popular color-coded portion-control containers as their way of eating. Users can search and filter recipes by container color, meal category, dietary needs, etc. to gain inspiration on meal planning. Actual recipe ingredients and directions are not available; simply the container counts and source.

### How to Use

The official Eat The Rainbow app can be found here: https://eattherainbow.recipes

### Future Updates

This is my first and on-going React project. Eventually I would like to implement the following enhancements:

1. Improve pagination or infinite scrolling
2. Add user rating / "Most Popular"
3. Sort by recently added
