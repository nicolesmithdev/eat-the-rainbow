## Eat The Rainbow

I created this web app to serve those who utilize popular color-coded portion-control containers as their way of eating. Users can search and filter recipes by container color, meal category, dietary needs, etc. to gain inspiration on meal planning. Actual recipe ingredients and directions are not available; simply the container counts and source.

### How to Use

The official Eat The Rainbow app can be found here: https://eattherainbow.recipes

### Future Updates

This is my first React project, but because this application has been in demand, I wanted to soft launch it in beta while I cataloged recipes and improved components. Eventually I would like to implement the following updates:

1. Correct vegan specific containers
2. Improve pagination or infinite scrolling
3. Integrate timed-nutrition filter(s)
4. Add user rating / "Most Popular"
5. Incorporate user-submitted recipe images
